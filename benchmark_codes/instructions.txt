To run these benchmarks, simply copy the benchmarks folder into oceananigans. Make sure to install the correct version of Julia and Oceananigans using the Julia website. Package managers do not ship recent enough versions. You will need to install some packages. This is not a perfect process, however, running julia --project benchmark_name should do the trick. A subission script for SLRUM jobs can also be found in this directory.
