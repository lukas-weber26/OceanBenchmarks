This is a set of new bencharks intended to address the following questions: 
-How does the A100 perform given a larger domain?
-How does the H100 compare to the A100? Is the level of optimization similar?
-Do three dimensional models work as well as two dimensional models? How do they scale?
-How do the different shallow water models compare?

Note that only the H100 and A100 were tested because the model size is too large for other platforms to be viable. Note that a 1600 * 1600 grid was tested but could not be run due to memory limitations.
